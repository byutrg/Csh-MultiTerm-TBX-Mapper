For example, the term WWW could have the following tag to point to its full form: <termNote type="abbreviatedFormFor" target="tidworldwideweb">World Wide Web</termNote>. The actual content of the element would be the text World Wide Web, which allows the user to see what term is the full form of the current term without having to go to the location of the full form in the file (the location would normally be somewhere within the current entry, since the abbreviated form and the full form represent the same concept). The element content shall be expressed in basicText. The identification of a relation between an abbreviated term and its full form indicates which term in a terminological entry is the full form of the abbreviated term. In many languages, English abbreviations are commonly used, but the English full form may be avoided in favor of an equivalent full form in the language in question. In this case, the English abbreviation and the target language full form will both appear in the target language section of the entry.');

The target attribute should point to the identifier of the <tig> corresponding to the target term. In the case of the values monodirectional and bidirectional, the target term is the preferred term. The content of the <termNote> element when it has a type attribute value of ''directionality'' indicates the scope of directionality, and shall be one of the following:

	• monodirectional: The translation is only preferred going from the source language (current <tig> to the target language (target <tig>).
	• bidirectional: The translation is preferred in both directions, i.e. the term in the target <tig> is a preferred translation of the term in the current <tig> and vice-versa.
	• incommensurate: The relation between the term in the current <tig> and the term in the target <tig> as translations is imperfect and should be used with care. In this case, the concepts are not equal. A <termNote type="transferComment"> should be used to provide information about the difference between the concepts.

INSERT INTO `categories` VALUES (68,'shortFormFor','basicText','term','<termNote>','','term','A linking element used to identify a relation between the subject term when it is a short form, and its full or expanded form. It may be coupled with a target attribute to point to the full or expanded form. Normally both the short form and the full form will be contained in the same entry, but each in its own <tig>, because they represent the same concept. For example, the term United States could have the following markup to point to the full form term United States of America: <termNote type="shortFormFor" target="tid-unitedstatesofamerica>United States of America</termNote>. The content of the element would be the target term, expressed in basicText, which allows the user to see the target term without going to its location in the entry. The identification of a relation between a short form and its full form indicates which term in a terminological entry is the full form of the short form.');
